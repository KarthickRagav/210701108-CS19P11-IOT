WORKING:
An Arduino controls LED lights representing traffic signals (red, yellow, green) based on sensor inputs. A PIR sensor detects pedestrians, triggering a green light for safe crossing. An optional RFID reader identifies authorized emergency vehicles with tags, granting them priority by switching lights to allow immediate passage. The system is  further enhanced with a microphone to detect emergency vehicles based on sirens, with additional sound processing code. Overall, this prototype demonstrates a cost-effective approach to improving traffic flow and emergency response times in developing regions.
